# Probabilistic Data Structures

See [DeepWiki analysis](https://deepwiki.com/mohsen3/ProbabilisticDataStructures) of this repository.

Probabilistic Data Structures (also known as _sketches_) sacrifice a little bit of precision to gain a huge advantage in performance, scalability, and memory usage compared to their deterministic counterparts. [This article](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/~graham/pubs/papers/cacm-sketch.pdf) is a good introduction to the topic.

This repository hosts a number of these data structures. Implementations are optimized for clarity and readability and are aimed at educational purposes. The list currently includes the following sketches:

* Bloom filter
* Count-Min Sketch
* HyperLogLog
* Reservoir Sampling
